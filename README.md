<h1> Spam Mail Classification </h1>
<p>The Spam Mail Classification Project develops a machine learning system to automatically detect and filter spam emails. It involves preprocessing email data, extracting relevant features from email content using methods like TF-IDF and bag-of-words, and training models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and deep learning techniques. The system classifies emails in real-time, reducing manual effort and improving email security. Future improvements include using advanced deep learning models like BERT, adapting to new spam techniques, and incorporating active learning for continuous model refinement. The project offers a scalable solution for enhancing email management and cybersecurity.</p>
<h2>How to execute the project</h2>
Setup Environment: Install Python and necessary libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, tensorflow, etc.).

Data Collection: Use datasets like the Enron Spam Dataset. Preprocess the data by cleaning the text (removing stop words, tokenization).

Feature Extraction: Convert email content into numerical features using TF-IDF or Bag of Words.

Model Training: Train models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Random Forest using scikit-learn to classify emails.

Evaluate Model: Use performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score to assess the model.

Real-Time Classification: For new emails, use the trained model to classify whether they are spam or not.

Improvement: Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., BERT) for better accuracy, handle class imbalance, and deploy the model for real-time use if needed.

By following these steps, you can create and deploy a spam mail classification system.
